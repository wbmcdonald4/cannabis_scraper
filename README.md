# Cannabis Scraper

# Description

This project was for a consulting gig I had with a company selling cannabis products based in Toronto.

This project solved three main problems for them:

1. Kept their CRM up to date with a source of truth of active stores based on the government listings.
2. Updated the sales team when a new store opened.
3. Leveraged outsourced data collection, to gain an idea of distribution.


The project remained live for around 18 months, until we shut it down to find a more scaleable solution.
